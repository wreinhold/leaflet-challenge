# leaflet-challenge

This repository was created as a homework assignment for the UNC Data Science Bootcamp. In it, I created a map (index.html) that tracks the earthquake data from the last week as available on https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

This assignment required me to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can find my code for JS and CSS in the static directory. The map has been styled so that each of the earthquakes in the last week are shown as circles. The size of the circle is determined by the magnitude, and the color is determined by the depth. 

The data for each earthquake can be viewed as a popup when clicked on the website. 

I made use of the code on https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO (accessed through https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59453642/how-to-add-legend-in-leaflet-map) in order to build the legend for the map.
